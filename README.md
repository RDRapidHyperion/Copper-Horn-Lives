This data pack adds one simple item: [Copper Horns](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Copper_Horn), an item that was once a part of the Wild Update's development, but then was removed shortly afterward.

By simply dropping a goat horn and 3 copper ingots onto a crafting table, you'll craft a copper horn. To use the item, right click to play a tune. If you do it while looking up, it'll play a higher pitched tune, and while crouching, it'll play a bass tune.

There are 10 copper horn variants that can be crafted from each goat horn variant.

In version 2.0, the data pack includes 2 new goat horns: Fly and Resist, which can be dropped from regular and screaming goats respectively. These will let you craft all of the copper horns.

You can also obtain these items using commands, like ``/function chl:give/all`` or ``/function chl:give/great_sky_falling``.
